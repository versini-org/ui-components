    <h1>Installation</h1>
    <p>
    	The <strong>UI-Components</strong> library is available as multiple npm
    	packages. The library has been split into multiple packages to make it
    	easier to manage and to reduce the size of the final bundle. Most are
    	individual components such as Button, Card, and Spinner. Other "specialty"
    	packages have been created to handle styles, system and icons:
    </p>
    <div className="my-2 flex flex-wrap">
    	<Table
    		column1="Package name"
    		column2="Description"
    		data={tableData.installation.data}
    	/>
    </div>
    <p>
    <strong>NOTE</strong>: each package content is detailed in this
    documentation. You can find them in the navigation bar.
    </p>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>
    If you only need some core components such as Button and Card, and of
    course the CSS styles associated<sup>1</sup>, use the following command:
    </p>
    <Highlight
    	codeBlock={codeBlocks.install.code}
    	language={codeBlocks.install.language}
    />

    	<p>
    		You also need to install React and React-DOM (at least 18.0.0 or above).
    	</p>
    	<Highlight
    		codeBlock={codeBlocks.installReact.code}
    		language={codeBlocks.installReact.language}
    	/>
